ðŸ’¼ Managing personal finance is a real hassle.

Your cash, cards, assets, and investments are scattered across different bank accounts, apps, and platforms. Trying to pull it all together in a spreadsheet is a nightmare ðŸ˜± - all that manual data entry just sucks the joy out of managing your money.

You end up wasting hours trying to get a clear picture of your net worth and cash flow, only to still feel uncertain about the best way to save, invest, and plan for the future. It's enough to make anyone feel grumpy and overwhelmedðŸ˜¤.
